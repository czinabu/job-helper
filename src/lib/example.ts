  letter: `Dear Hiring Manager,

Last year I cut produce waste at my store by 18% by reading our sales trends and changing how we ordered. Turning store data into a decision someone can act on is what your Junior Data Analyst role is about, and it's the work I want to do full time.

For five years I've worked in grocery store operations at Fieldstone Market, most recently as Assistant Store Manager. I built a weekly Excel tracker for shrink and waste that our district now uses in six stores, and each week I prepare sales reports and walk the district manager through the results. I know what store and district leaders need from the numbers, because I've been the one using them.

I've been building the technical side to match. In 2025 I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I learned SQL, and I built a Tableau Public dashboard comparing grocery prices across Ohio. I haven't used Power BI or Python yet, and I'd welcome the chance to learn them on your team.

I'd like to talk about how I could help Brightline's store operations team see what's selling, what's going to waste, and where to act. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Sam Ortega`,
